## üåü Featured Projects

Here are a few repositories I'm proud of:

### üåê [`UN_Conflict_Report`](https://github.com/pablo-fdz/UN_Conflict_Report)

An end-to-end pipeline that generates forward-looking security reports for any country using a GraphRAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) approach. Developed for the United Nations Development Programme as part of the Data Science for Decision-Making's master's thesis, together with [Anastasiia Chernavskaia](https://github.com/ananstr) and [Blanca Jim√©nez](https://github.com/blancajimenezzzz).

> üì∞ Ingests data from sources like ACLED, Factal, and Google News.
>
> üï∏Ô∏è Builds and queries a Neo4j knowledge graph with Google's Gemini LLM.
>
> üìù Automatically creates grounded country security reports using GraphRAG for context retrieval and a lightweight Python program.
>
> ‚úÖ Includes a novel pipeline for LLM-based factual accuracy evaluation and report correction.

### ‚öñÔ∏è [`adv_nlp_final_assessment`](https://github.com/pablo-fdz/adv_nlp_final_assessment)

An in-depth exploration of Natural Language Processing techniques for the task of Legal Judgment Prediction on a dataset of Swiss Federal Supreme Court cases.

> ü§ñ Benchmarks BERT-based models, including domain-specific ones like `CamemBERT` and `JuriBERT`, against rule-based and random baselines.
>
> üß™ Explores various techniques to tackle data scarcity, including few-shot learning with `SetFit`, data augmentation, and synthetic data generation using LLMs.
>
> ‚öôÔ∏è Implements knowledge distillation and quantization to create smaller, faster models for efficient inference.
>
> üìä Provides a comprehensive analysis of model performance, learning curves, and the impact of severe class imbalance on a complex, real-world text classification task.

### üõ∞Ô∏è [`DL_improc_final_project`](https://github.com/pablo-fdz/DL_improc_final_project)

A deep learning project to assess wildfire severity trends in Catalonia using satellite imagery. It implements a U-Net model to classify fire damage from Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data.

> üõ∞Ô∏è Leverages both optical (Sentinel-2) and SAR (Sentinel-1) satellite data for a comprehensive analysis.
>
> ‚öôÔ∏è Implements an end-to-end pipeline: from automated data retrieval via the Copernicus API to model training and inference.
>
> üóÇÔ∏è Classifies wildfire damage into five severity levels using a U-Net semantic segmentation model.
>
> üìà Analyzes and performs statistical tests on wildfire severity trends in Catalonia over the last decade (2014-2023).

### üöõ [`lab_3_data_mg`](https://github.com/pablo-fdz/lab_3_data_mg)
> üí° Designed and implemented a multidimensional database schema for a data warehouse using SQL.
>
> ‚õìÔ∏è Developed a complete ETL pipeline to extract, transform, and load data into the warehouse efficiently.
>
> ‚ùî OLAP and ROLAP queries on the data warehouse.

### üó∫Ô∏è [`geospatial_final_project`](https://github.com/pablo-fdz/geospatial_final_project)
> üß™ An empirical study of the effect of wildfires on electoral outcomes in Catalunya and Comunitat Valenciana.
> 
> üîç We use wildifre perimeter boundaries and the outcomes of the general elections in both regions from the year 2000 onwards.
> 
> üìà Two-way fixed effects and wildfire occurrence used as the identification strategy.

### üîß [`CDS_final_project`](https://github.com/pablo-fdz/CDS_final_project)
> üì¶ Scalable machine learning library which includes pre-processing, training, hyperparameter optimization and prediction. It is based on the principles of object-oriented programming and created to be compatible with `scikit-learn`.
> 
> ‚úÖ Built with Python, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, FastAPI, etc.
